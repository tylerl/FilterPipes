# FilterPipes

FilterPipes is a SublimeText (v2 and v3) plugin for filtering selected text
through pipes or filters, either written as Python functions or as external
processes.

This project lives at [github.com/tylerl/FilterPipes](https://github.com/tylerl/FilterPipes).

### Filter Through Process
This plugin provides a prompt for you to supply the shell command to execute.

### Filter Through Python
Python code can also be used as the filter function. Several useful examples
are provided as listed below, but the real power comes in when you create your
own functions.

### Creating Custom Filters
FilterPipes makes it crazy-simple for you to create your own custom filter
plugins. There are some pre-defined classes for simple text replacement,
regular expressions, character-for-character translations, and external
processes.
