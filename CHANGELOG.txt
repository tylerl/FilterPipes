Version: 1.1.0 [Apr 27, 2015]
-----------------------------
Allow non-zero returns from external processes.
  FilterPipesProcessCommand now has an "expected_returns" parameter
  which allows you to specify a list of "success" return codes. It
  defaults to just [0], which is typical. Setting this to an empty
  set or false will disable checking the return code, and assume
  all returns are successful.

Allow arbitrary options to be passed to Popen.
  Added parameter 'subprocess_args' to FilterPipesProcessCommand,
  which allows you to specify any additional parameters to pass to
  your subprocess call, such as a specific working directory or environment.
